Space:
- rewrite all matrix operations to use 4x4 matrices with homogenous coordinates
- redefine camera orientation to use matrices not just angles
- rewrite projection and view-space mapping to use 4-matrices
- port over gravity and collision detection from the openGL project to enable 'landing'

Polygons:
- polygons
- rasterising (filling projected polygons)
- frustrum clipping
- hiding objects behind others
